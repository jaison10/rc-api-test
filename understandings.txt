mongoose is used when you have to deal with HTTP requests/API.
mongodb can be only used to push data to the mongodb db. But there is no server running.

mongoose can work similar to mongodb without any HTTP which is without using express. Pushing data manually.
But we can use express to run server, listen to a port and deal with HTTP requests. (get, post and all wont work without 
express). mongoose is used to connect to the db, where as express is used for server side.
